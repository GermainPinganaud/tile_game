# tile game

I want to make a tile based game editor online.

Anyone may be part of the project as long as the work is shared with the community.
Some unnamed tile game by Germain PINGANAUD V0.1


- display a part of a sprite
- handling sprites in a palette canvas
- drawing sprites with the clic on a level canvas
- selecting a tile from a palette and draw on the level canvas
